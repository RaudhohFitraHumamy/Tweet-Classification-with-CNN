# Tweet-Classification-with-CNN


This is my old project, containing tweet classification using CNN. Developed at the time Palu-Donggala earthquake in Indonesia happened, it was expected that this neural net algorithm could better identifying structures of unstructure twitter text. Through its convoluting kernels, it was believed that this algorithm could be better classifying tweets into 4 classes : report, relief, sentiment, non-earthquake information.

This script still on development process.
